# Online-reservation-system
For the online reservation system project, I implemented a Java program that allows users to view seat availability, reserve seats, cancel reservations, and exit the system. Here's an overview of what I did:

Main Menu: Created a main menu interface where users can select various options.

Users can view the seat map, reserve seats, cancel reservations, or exit the program.
View Seat Map: Implemented a feature to display the current seat map.

The seat map shows the availability of seats, with "X" indicating reserved seats and seat numbers for empty seats.
Reserve Seats: Developed functionality for users to reserve multiple seats at once.

Users can specify the number of seats they want to reserve and input the seat numbers separated by spaces.
If a seat is already reserved or an invalid seat number is provided, appropriate messages are displayed.
Cancel Reservations: Implemented functionality for users to cancel multiple reservations at once.

Users can specify the number of reservations they want to cancel and input the seat numbers separated by spaces.
If a seat is not reserved or an invalid seat number is provided, appropriate messages are displayed.
Exit Program: Provided an option for users to exit the program.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, including array manipulation, user input handling, and menu-driven application design. Additionally, it showcases problem-solving skills by efficiently managing seat reservations and cancellations.
